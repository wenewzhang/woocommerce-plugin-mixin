= Functionality =

* Extend your invoice expiration time (if payouts are in BTC).
* Accept slight underpayments automatically.
* Refunds can be issued directly from the invoice - without involvement of the seller.

= How it works - example =

1. An item in the store costs 100 euro.
2. A customer wants to buy the item and selects to pay with Bitcoin.
3. An invoice is generated and, according to the current exchange rate, the price is 10,000 euro per bitcoin, so the customer has to pay 0.01 bitcoins.
4. Once the invoice is paid, the merchant gets a notification and is credited 99 euro (100 euro minus our 1% flat fee), or 0.0099 BTC.
